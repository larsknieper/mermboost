Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lars Knieper, Torsten Hothorn, Elisabeth Bergherr, Colin Griesbach
Maintainer: Lars Knieper <lars.knieper@uni-goettingen.de>
Description: Offers a novel boosting framework to estimate mixed models via gradient boosting.
    The implemented functions are based on 'mboost' and 'lme4'. Hence, the family range is predetermined by 'lme4'. 
    A correction mechanism for cluster-constant covariates is implemented as well as an estimation of random effects' covariance.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0), mboost, lme4,stabs
Imports: Matrix, MASS,  parallel, data.table, stringr, tibble

Description: Provides a novel framework to estimate mixed models
    via gradient boosting. The implemented functions are based on 'mboost' and 'lme4'. 
    Hence, the family range is predetermined by 'lme4'. A correction mechanism 
    for cluster-constant covariates is implemented as well as an estimation of random 
    effects' covariance.

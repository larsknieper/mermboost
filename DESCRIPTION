Title: Gradient Boosting for Generalised Additive Mixed Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Lars Knieper, Torsten Hothorn, Elisabeth Bergherr, Colin Griesbach

Description: Offers a novel boosting framework to estimate mixed models
    via gradient boosting.  The implemented functions are based on
    'mboost' and 'lme4'. Hence, the family range is predetermined by
    'lme4'.  A correction mechanism for cluster-constant covariates is
    implemented as well as an estimation of random effects' covariance.
